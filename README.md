#### Test Cases:

- It should open the main screen

- It should acces the Dialogs screen
- It should acces the Forms screen
- It should access the Avengers screen
- It should select the Python radio button
- It should check Robot Framework checkbox
- It should do a simple click
- It should do a long click
- It should select the QA spinner on the sign up form
- It should select the DevOps spinner on the sign up form
- It should remove Captain America of Avengers list

After running all test cases I've got Robot Framework reports with screenshots which are a very interesting way to document all tests performed.
